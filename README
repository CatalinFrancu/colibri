Colibri is a suicide chess engine, playing according to freechess.org rules.
I developed this program using Code::Blocks, but I used cbp2make (revision 137
at the time of writing this document) to generate a Makefile:

cd /path/to/colibri/codeblocks
cbp2make -in colibri.cbp -out Makefile
make

The resulting binary is /path/to/colibri/bin/Release/colibri.

I'll try to keep this Makefile up to date as the project changes, but you can
always use cbp2make to generate the latest version of a Makefile.
